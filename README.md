## Description

An existing marketing agencies website code and assets (HTML & CSS) were extracted and then code refactored to include:

1.  An amended codebase which follows accessibilty standards - such as the inclusion of alt tags on images.
2.  Improved optimization for search engines - such as removing div classes and instead using more semantic elements. 
3. Consolidation and organization of the CSS selectors and properties to follow a more organized semantic structure and easy readability. 

The original design and look of the website was not changed in anyway, the code was only refactored.
